# Immersion Cigs Hotfix

This is a Mod for ArmA 3 that is supposed to run in dependency with Rebel/Facel's [Immersion Cigs - Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753946944) - [Immersion Cigs - Git Hub](https://github.com/rebelvg/immersion_cigs/tree/master).

As the Original Author [Rebel](https://github.com/rebelvg) stated that they currently not have the means to maintain this project, i choose to provide some minor QoL changes as a seperate Mod that will overwrite the original functions with the updated version until the original authors can maintain the project again.

## What are the Changes?

- When taking a new Cigarette from the box it will try to put the cig first in the face slot, then the NVG slot and only afterwards, will put it in the first available slot in the inventory.
- Allows to light someone else's cig when its in the NVG slot.
