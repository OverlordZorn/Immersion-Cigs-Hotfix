# Immersion Cigs Hotfix

This is a Mod for ArmA 3 that is supposed to run in dependency with Rebel/Facel's:
[Immersion Cigs - Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753946944)
[Immersion Cigs - Git Hub](https://github.com/rebelvg/immersion_cigs/tree/master)

As the original Author [Rebel](https://github.com/rebelvg) stated, they are currently not in the position to maintain this project. 
This is an effort to provide some minor QoL changes as a seperate Mod that will overwrite the original functions until the original authors can maintain the project again and these changes might get merged into the original mod.

## What are the Changes?

- When taking a new Cigarette from the box, it will try to put the cig first in the goggles/face slot, ifn't, then the NVG slot and only as a last resort, it will put it in the inventory.
- Allows to light someone else's cig when its in the NVG slot.


### Note
This hotfix currently only works in conjunction with ace.
